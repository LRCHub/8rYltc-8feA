I'm headed for a fall...
I'm sure you've heard it all. before
Oh nothing seems to change...
It always turns out the same

I'll never never get you outta my mind.
Ya know I think of it all the time
I'm goin' crazy but it's somethin' I can't explain...
The situation is insane

The feelin' keeps on growin' on inside me
I want to reach ya, want to let ya know.
Ooh why can't love be easy
But I just can't let ya go

I'm havin' a breakdown, breakdown
Oh break, havin' a breakdown, breakdown
Ya know yer bringin' me down
Havin' a breakdown, breakdown
Oh, oh..., I'm havin' a breakdown, breakdown
Oh ya know I'm breakin' down

Conversation that would make him feel so fine...
Ya know we're talkin' between the lines
Try to resist you but the little things you say...
I find it hard ta turn away

This feelin' keeps on growin' on inside me
I want to teach you, everything I know...
Ooh, love can be so easy
Why don't ya just let go

I'm havin' a breakdown, breakdown
Oh., I'm havin' a breakdown, breakdown
Ya know yer bringin' me down
I'm havin' a breakdown, break, break, breakdown...
Havin' a breakdown, breakdown
Oh I'm, I'm breakin'
Havin' a breakdown, breakdown
Oh I'm goin' down
Havin' a breakdown, breakdown
Oh ya know I'm usually-
Havin' a, oh, oh. oh... no
A break, breakdown

It's really gettin' to me
