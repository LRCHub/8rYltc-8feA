I'm not the man I used to be
Fell down a time or two
When luck was lookin' out for me
I missed the knock
And never knew
I let you go
But you can't get away from me again

Do you want me to plead?
Do you want me to cry?
Any proof that you need
Any promise you'll buy
Do you want me to break down the door
Do you want me to break down the door
Break down the door

You say you saw me lose control
Look now I'm in the lead
And you can have me heart and soul
I'm overhauled
And guaranteed
What do you say
Why don't you take a chance
On me again

Do you want me to plead?
Do you want me to cry?
Any proof that you need
Any promise you'll buy
Do you want me to break down the door
Do you want me to break down the door
Break down the door

Can't say for sure what's comin'
It ain't what's gone before
Except we had some damn good times
And I know we both want more

Do you want me to plead?
Do you want me to cry?
Any proof that you need
Any promise you'll buy
Do you want me to break
Do you want me to break down
Do you want me to break down the
Do you want me to break down the door
